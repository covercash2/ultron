  I'd just like to interject for a moment. \
  What you're referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, \
  or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. \
  Linux is not an operating system unto itself, \
  but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system \
  made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS \
  as defined by POSIX.

  Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, \
  without realizing it. \
  Through a peculiar turn of events, \
  the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called \"Linux\", \
  and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, \
  developed by the GNU Project.\

  There really is a Linux, \
  and these people are using it, \
  but it is just a part of the system they use. \
  Linux is the kernel: \
  the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run. \
  The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; \
  it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. \
  Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: \
  the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. \
  All the so-called \"Linux\" distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux.

googlers = """\
  The key point here is our programmers are Googlers, \
  theyâ€™re not researchers. \
  Theyâ€™re typically, fairly young, fresh out of school, \
  probably learned Java, maybe learned C or C++, probably learned Python. \
  Theyâ€™re not capable of understanding a brilliant language \
  but we want to use them to build good software. \
  So, the language that we give them has to be easy for them to understand \
  and easy to adopt.

rick_and_morty = """\
  To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. \
  The humour is extremely subtle, \
  and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics \
  most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. \
  There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, \
  which is deftly woven into his characterisation- \
  his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. \
  The fans understand this stuff; \
  they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, \
  to realise that they're not just funny- \
  they say something deep about LIFE. \
  As a consequence people who dislike Rick & Morty truly ARE idiots- \
  of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, \
  the humour in Rick's existential catchphrase \"Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,\" \
  which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. \
  I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads \
  in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. \

open_source_maintainers = """\
  Most maintainers start working on open source software \

  Many continue out of a sense of obligation instead of fun \

  When they make a controversial decision and receive abuse for it, \
